# Calorie Tracker — MVP Scope

## Positioning

A calorie and wellness tracker for women that connects **food, activity, mood, sleep, cravings, weight, and cycle or life-stage patterns** — so daily choices feel easier to understand in context, not judged in isolation.

The app supports awareness and pattern tracking. It does not diagnose, treat, or claim to fix hormonal or medical conditions. Copy should use language like **track patterns** and **support awareness**, and avoid claims such as “fix hormones” or “optimize hormones.”

## Design direction

The product is moving from a dark, gym-style calorie dashboard to a **warmer, mobile-first wellness experience** inspired by calm nourishment apps — not a pixel-perfect clone of any reference.

**Visual tone:** soft, grounded, and feminine without being clinical. The UI should feel like a supportive daily companion, not a performance tracker.

**Palette (guidance):**
- Warm ivory / off-white page background
- Soft cream cards with thin beige borders and gentle shadows
- Muted terracotta or clay as the primary accent (nourishment ring, key numbers)
- Sage green as a secondary accent (activity, balance)
- Supporting accents: blush, lavender, pale blue, pale gold — used sparingly for mood, sleep, and cycle context
- Deep espresso brown for primary text; taupe / warm gray for secondary text

**Typography (no custom font packages in MVP):**
- Refined system serif stack for greetings, names, and large numbers
- Clean system sans-serif for labels, cards, and navigation

**Dashboard layout (MVP shell):**
1. Greeting header with name, date, optional cycle or life-stage label, and a gentle focus message
2. Main nourishment card — circular calorie progress, eaten vs target, remaining, macro placeholder bars
3. Wellness snapshot grid — mood, sleep, energy, activity (sample data until logging ships)
4. Cycle / body insight card — supportive copy with “may notice” language, not medical advice
5. Today’s check-in card — display sample check-in values (no form yet)
6. Bottom navigation — Today, Log, Insights, Profile (decorative until routing exists)

**Important:** The warm wellness layer sits on top of the same simple MVP core. Visual richness does not expand scope into medical analytics, AI coaching, or complex cycle forecasting.

## Goals

Build a simple, reliable calorie-tracking app that helps users log food and activity, view a daily calorie summary, and track progress against their energy needs — all without external paid APIs.

**MVP focus:** A working calorie tracker with food logging, activity logging, user profile, daily calorie summary, daily body check-in, and optional cycle or life-stage context on a simple warm dashboard. Targets are set from profile data and standard formulas — not auto-adjusted from trends in the first release.

The lean differentiator layer (below) adds lightweight body and cycle context on top of that core — without turning the MVP into a medical or AI product.

## Lean Differentiator Layer

Small MVP additions that connect calories to how the body feels day to day. Wording throughout should emphasize **track patterns** and **support awareness**, not optimization or medical outcomes.

### 1. Daily Body Check-In

A simple daily form with:

- **energy:** 1–5
- **mood:** 1–5
- **hunger:** 1–5
- **cravings:** none / mild / strong
- **sleep quality:** 1–5
- **stress:** 1–5
- **bloating:** none / mild / strong
- **soreness:** none / mild / strong
- **notes:** optional

### 2. Cycle Context

In profile settings:

- **cycle tracking enabled:** yes / no
- **last period start date**
- **average cycle length**
- **average period length**
- **optional current life stage:** regular cycle / irregular cycle / perimenopause / menopause / prefer not to say

### 3. Simple Cycle-Aware Dashboard Label

No complex predictions. Just simple labels such as:

- Cycle day 18
- Estimated luteal phase
- Period expected in about 6 days
- Cycle tracking off

### 4. Flexible Daily Target Mode

Options:

- Maintain
- Gentle deficit
- Performance / energy
- Recovery day

For MVP, these mainly adjust **messaging and framing** on the dashboard — not complex calorie math or automatic target recalculation.

### 5. Basic Pattern Insight Placeholder

**Before enough data:**

- “Log at least 7 days to see body pattern insights.”

**After enough data:**

- Show simple averages only (e.g. average energy, mood, or hunger by cycle phase label) — not AI-generated recommendations.

## Non-goals (MVP)

- **No AI recommendations yet** — no meal suggestions, coaching, or personalized AI insights
- **No medical claims** — no language about fixing, optimizing, or balancing hormones; not medical advice
- **No complex cycle forecasting** — no ovulation prediction, fertility windows, or clinical-grade cycle modeling
- **No full menopause analytics yet** — life stage is optional context only, not a dedicated analytics module
- **No dynamic metabolic adaptation yet** — targets stay fixed from profile and formulas (see Future roadmap)
- **No restaurant database yet** — manual food logging and user-added entries only (see Future roadmap)
- **No barcode scanning yet**
- **No wearable integrations yet**
- Paid AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Photo-based food recognition
- Social features, meal plans, or mental health modules

## Row-level security (RLS)

- `profiles` — users can read/write only their own row (`user_id = auth.uid()`)
- `daily_check_ins` — users can read/write only their own rows
- `food_logs` — users can read/write only their own rows
- `activity_logs` — users can read/write only their own rows
- `foods` — all users can read seeded foods; users can insert foods where `created_by = auth.uid()`
- `activities` — all authenticated users can read (reference table)

## Calorie formulas

All calculations live in `lib/calories.ts` (Phase 2). Pure functions — deterministic, testable, zero API cost.

### BMR — Mifflin-St Jeor

- **Male:** `10 × weight_kg + 6.25 × height_cm − 5 × age + 5`
- **Female:** `10 × weight_kg + 6.25 × height_cm − 5 × age − 161`

### TDEE

`TDEE = BMR × activity_multiplier`

| Activity level | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| sedentary | 1.2 |
| light | 1.375 |
| moderate | 1.55 |
| active | 1.725 |
| very_active | 1.9 |

### Food intake

`calories = calories_per_serving × servings`

### Activity burn (MET-based)

`calories_burned = MET × weight_kg × (duration_minutes / 60)`

### Daily summary

```
net_calories = total_food_intake − total_activity_burn
remaining    = TDEE − net_calories   (positive = under target)
```

Daily target mode does **not** change these formulas in MVP — it only affects user-facing copy on the dashboard.

## AI extension points (future — not implemented)

The MVP keeps core calorie math separate from any AI layer so features can be added later without refactoring logs or profiles.

### `lib/calories.ts`

Pure formula functions. AI never replaces these — it only augments recommendations on top of the same data.

### `lib/ai/gateway.ts` (future stub)

Planned facade interface:

```typescript
// Future — not implemented in MVP
interface AIHealthGateway {
  suggestMeals(context: UserCalorieContext): Promise<MealSuggestion[]>;
  suggestWorkout(context: UserActivityContext): Promise<WorkoutSuggestion[]>;
  generateInsights(context: UserHabitContext): Promise<HealthInsight[]>;
}
```

- No AI SDK dependencies in `package.json` until explicitly enabled
- No API keys required for MVP
- Log and profile schemas remain stable so AI can read historical data later

## Future roadmap (not MVP)

Features planned after the core MVP is stable. **Do not implement these in the first release.**

### Dynamic calorie adjustments / metabolic adaptation

Adjust calorie and macro targets on a weekly cadence based on weight trends and intake history (e.g. when actual loss/gain diverges from expected rates).

**Why deferred:**
- Requires enough logged data (weight entries, consistent food logs) before adjustments are meaningful
- Needs careful safety messaging so users understand limits, medical context, and that the app is not medical advice
- MVP should use fixed TDEE/budget from profile and formulas until logging habits are established

### Restaurant menu logging

Help users log chain-restaurant meals via a restaurant menu database or crowdsourced nutrition data (search by restaurant and menu item instead of only generic foods).

**Why deferred:**
- MVP food logging starts with a simple manual `foods` table and user-added entries
- Restaurant data sourcing, accuracy, and maintenance add scope beyond basic calorie tracking
- Can be layered on once core food logging and daily summary work reliably

### Advanced cycle and body pattern analytics

Richer correlations between check-ins, cycle phase, and intake — potentially with AI-assisted summaries. Deferred until simple averages and manual logging habits are proven.

## Phase 2+ build order

1. Runnable Next.js shell — `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `.gitignore`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`
2. Supabase setup — project, env vars, tables, RLS policies, seed `foods` and `activities`
3. Auth — signup/login pages, session middleware, protected routes
4. Profile — onboarding form for age, sex, height, weight, body fat %, and optional cycle context
5. Food logging — search/select from `foods`, log servings
6. Activity logging — select activity, enter duration, MET-based burn
7. Daily summary + dashboard — net calories, TDEE comparison, cycle-aware label, daily target mode messaging
8. Daily body check-in — form and storage
9. Pattern insight placeholder — 7-day gate and simple averages
10. Polish — basic styling, empty states, form validation
